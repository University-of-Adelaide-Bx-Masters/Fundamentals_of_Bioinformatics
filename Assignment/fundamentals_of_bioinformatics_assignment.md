# Practical Assignment 1a - Fundamentals of Bioinformatics

This assignment covers all material in Module 1 - Fundamentals of Bioinformatics. 
It is split into two parts with 30 marks for each part. 

### Submission Details

- All bash/shell scripts should be uploaded as separate `.sh` files. All output files should be submitted as separate `.txt` files. 
- **All scripts should use tools and techniques covered in the module**. 
- Question 4 should be provided as a single pdf. An easy way to do this is to complete your assignment in Word (or another word processor) and export/save your final document as a pdf.  Alternatively, you are welcome to use Rmarkdown, LaTeX, or something similar that can produce pdf output. 
- Please ensure that this pdf contains your name, student number, and the assignment name (Practical Assignment 1a - Fundamentals of Bioinformatics).

## Part 1 - Bash 

You will need to produce two valid bash scripts and three output files for Part 1 of this assignment. Each bash script must be named in the format axxxxxxx_Q1.sh or axxxxxxx_Q2.sh.

You will be able to write these scripts by repurposing the code and techniques from the first three practicals.

### Q1. Write a bash script to [14 marks]: 
a. Download the gff3 file for your assigned species (see bottom of page) to your current directory from Ensembl [1 mark]

b. Count how many of each feature type there is, sorted in numerical order [4 marks]

c. Count how many gene features have a gene_biotype attribute of protein_coding, and how many have a gene_biotype attribute of lncRNA [4 marks]

d. Export the results to a file with a name of the form `axxxxxxx_my_species_gff_features.txt` where you use your assigned species name instead of my_species [1 mark]. NB: If the species name is missing or incorrect, no marks will be awarded for this section. The script must also include code to generate one or more comment lines in the output file/table before the table with the genome-build used, (hint: `grep` your gff to find the genome build info as the header is very large in most cases)

e. Include informative comments in your script to explain your code [1 mark]

f. The script must also write the code used to generate the summary (counts) data and count gene features to the output file as part of the file header. [3 marks]


### Q2. For the file we used in the practicals (Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.ncrna.fa), add to the final practical script provided so that  [16 marks]:

a. Two separate output files are now created, titled `axxxxxxx_dmel_ncrna_summary.txt` and `axxxxxxx_dmel_ncrna_chromosome_summary.txt` [1 mark]

b. For the first output file, ensure that:

  (i) This output contains a meaningful header [1 mark] 
  
  (ii) This output contains column names [1 marks]
  
  (iii) This output includes: a) gene id; b) chromosome; c) start; d) stop; e) strand and f) gene_biotype [3 marks]
  
c. For the second output file, ensure:

  (i) This output contains a meaningful header [1 mark]
  
  (ii) Count the number of gene transcripts assigned to each chromosome [4 marks]
  
  (iii) Print the ID names for ncRNAs found on the Y chromosome [4]
  
d. Include comments that make the script easier for yourself and others to understand [1 mark]


Note: If identical comments are identified in any submissions, a mark of **zero** will be given for this question for all suspicious submissions. 
You will be able to write your assignment scripts by repurposing the code and bioinformatics tools we went over in the first three practicals. 

## Part 2 - Next Generation Sequencing

#### Data
Athaliana reference genome:
https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/ensemblgenomes/pub/release-51/plants/fasta/arabidopsis_thaliana/dna/Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa.gz

SRR5882797_10M_1.fastq.gz https://adelaideuniversity.box.com/shared/static/egl3n16r0ziaxlvbs9074xqd1liktnuz.gz

SRR5882797_10M_2.fastq.gz https://adelaideuniversity.box.com/shared/static/g2ly4kzz1blus5juy426i37zl45o38pu.gz

### Q3. Variant Calling Script [18 marks]

Write a bash script to perform the variant calling analysis tasks listed below. **This script should use tools and techniques that were covered in the module.** 
 
**Note:** [1 mark] will be awarded for placing all files in the directories specified in the instructions below and [2 marks] will be awarded for including clear and concise comments throughout. 
 
Your script should do the following:
  
a. Download the reference genome (i.e. fasta file) of the model plant _Arabidopsis thaliana_ to the subdirectory `ref` from the Ensembl ftp directory using the link provided above and either `curl` or `wget`. [1 mark]

b. Download the sequencing data (Illumina paired-end reads) at the links provided to the directory `0_raw` using `curl` or `wget` and rename these files to the names provided alongside the links.  [3 marks]

c. Index the reference genome for use with `bwa`. You will need to unzip it first. [1 mark]

d. Run `fastqc` on raw reads. [1 mark]

e. Trim reads for poor quality bases using `fastp`. Write trimmed reads to the directory `1_trim`. [2 marks]

f. Align paired-end reads to the genome using `bwa mem`, resulting in a single BAM file in the directory `2_align`. Don't include read groups (exclude the `-R` option and the string following it). Ensure there are no intermediary SAM (`.sam`) files saved. [3 marks]

g. Sort and index your BAM file. Remove the unsorted BAM file after you've done this. [3 marks]

h. Call variants and write the vcf to `3_variants`. You do not need to mark duplicates for this analysis and should instead use your sorted BAM file from step 7 as input for variant calling. [1 mark]

i. Filter variants to keep only variants with QUAL>=30 and print the number of variants that meet this criteria to standard output (`stdout`). [2 marks]


### Q4. Short Answer Questions [12 marks]
a. Describe the 4 main components (the four lines) of a FASTQ read/record. [2 marks]

b. Illumina short reads suffer from a deterioration in quality towards the 3' end. Describe the process which causes this. [1 mark]

c. What does it mean if reads align as a proper pair? [1 mark]

d. Illumina short reads may contain portions of adapter sequences at their 3' end. Describe how and why some reads may contain parts of an adapter while others may not. [1 marks]

e. What is the difference between a SAM and a BAM file? [1 mark] 

f. Index files are regularly encountered in bioinformatics. For example, `.bai` (and `.csi`) is an index file for BAM files and `.fai` are index files of FASTA files. Describe, in general terms, what index files facilitate. [1 mark]

g. What is the difference between a local and global sequence alignment and under what general condition would you use them? [2 marks]

h. In protein residue sequence alignment we use a substitution matrix to score mismatches. Why can't all amino acid substitutions be considered equal? [2 marks]

i. What does the bitwise SAM FLAG 83 indicate? [1 mark] 


## Species For Question 1

*If your student number is not listed, please contact Jess or Chelsea to ensure you are added to the list*

You can find the gff for your assigned species by going here: 'http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-100/gff3/' and clicking on your assigned species. 
Then, copy the path for the link ending in `.100.gff3.gz` by right clicking and choosing "Copy link address". Make sure you **DON'T** choose the file ending with `.100.abinitio.gff3.gz`. 
This path can now be used with either `curl` or `wget` to download the file.
